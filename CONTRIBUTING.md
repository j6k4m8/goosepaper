# Getting Involved

I'd love to see what you do with the codebase, and I want to see your configs too! :) Please feel free to submit pull-requests or feature requests, but keep in mind that many (!!) people now rely upon this codebase, so breaking changes (or complex installs) might take longer to get merged.

## Help Wanted!

If you're looking for a place to start getting your hands dirty, check out some potential options below.

### New Story Providers

Writing new Story Providers is a great place to start.

* Maybe one for GitHub notifications? 
* Maybe today's birthdays, pulled from Facebook? 
* Maybe your upcoming calendar events, via Google Calendar or another service?

### A "front-page" layout

I'd love to have a big ol' headline area for the most important story of the day.

### New styles!

Right now there's only one stylesheet. But perhaps you don't like my font choices??
