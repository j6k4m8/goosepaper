# Customizing Your Feed

## Example-config

You can choose what content is added to your daily goosepaper by writing your own config-file.
As an example we give the config delivered as an example `example-config.json`:

```json
{
    "font_size": 12,
    "stories": [
        {
            "provider": "weather",
            "config": { "woe": 2358820, "F": true }
        },
        {
            "provider": "twitter",
            "config": {
                "usernames": ["axios", "NPR"],
                "limit_per": 8
            }
        },
        {
            "provider": "wikipedia_current_events",
            "config": {}
        },
        {
            "provider": "rss",
            "config": {
                "rss_path": "https://www.npr.org/feed/",
                "limit": 5
            }
        },
        {
            "provider": "reddit",
            "config": { "subreddit": "news" }
        },
        {
            "provider": "reddit",
            "config": { "subreddit": "todayilearned" }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Titles and fontsize

In the first part of the config you can set global parameters for your goosepaper.
These do not need to be set as they have default parameters.

### Title

The title is at the top of the first page if your paper.
Default value is 
```json
"title" : "Daily Goosepaper"
```

### Subtitle

The subtitle is at the second line at the top of the first page after yout title.
Default value is 
```json
"subtitle" : ""
```

### Fontsize

The fontsize determines the fontsize for all text in the goosepaper, but not the title, subtitle, or weather if this is set in `stories` (covered later). The default value is 
```json
"font_size" : 14
```
(This only matters if your output is set as a `.pdf`)

Something about styles needs to go here!!!

## Stories and Storyproviders

The stories is the content you read in your goosepaper, and can be customized in a variety of ways.  
  
This section aims to be a comprehensive list of all storyproviders and how to configure them.  
(This was the case at time of writing.)  
  
In addition to the storyproviders listed here, there is also a separate repository, [auxilliary-goose](https://github.com/j6k4m8/auxiliary-goose/), where you can find additional storyproviders. For info on how to customize these check out the documentation in said repository.

Stories and storyproviders are given in the config-file using the `"stories"`-key in the following way:  
(remember correct comma-separation in this file).

```json
"stories" : [
	{
		"provider" 	: "Storyprovider 1",
		"config" 	: {
			"PARAMETER"	: "VALUE",
			"PARAMETER"	: "VALUE" 
		}
	},
	{
		"provider" 	: "Storyprovider 2",
		"config" 	: {
			"PARAMETER"	: "VALUE",
			"PARAMETER"	: "VALUE" 
		}
	},
]
```
  
As per now these storyproviders are available:
- [Lorem Ipsum](#LoremIpsum)

- [RSS](#RSS)

- [Weather](#Weather)
- [Wikipedia Current Events](#Wikipedia)
