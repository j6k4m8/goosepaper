## what's up

goosepaper is a utility that delivers a daily newspaper to your remarkable tablet. that's cute!

## usage

execute using [frof](https://github.com/j6k4m8/frof):

```shell
frof remarkable.frof
```

You can add this to a crontab to run daily in the morning.


## yes but pardon me — i haven't a remarkable tablet

Do you have another kind of tablet? You may generate a print-ready PDF which you can use on another kind of robot as well!

```shell
frof frofs/pdf-only.frof
```

# More Questions, Infrequently Asked

## very nice! may i have it in comic sans?

yes! you may do anything that you find to be fun and welcoming :)

Check out the `styles.Styles` enum in the goosepaper library. You will find there what you seek.

## i would like it to have my own name at the top: "Freenbu Wrimjilab". you may imagine how difficult it is to find things personalized with my name.

I can certainly appreciate how difficult that would be! You may change the Goosepaper constructor in the `main.py` script so that the `title=` argument reflects your wishes!


## do all dogs' names start with the letter "B"?

I do not think so, but it is a good question!

## may i use this to browse twitter?

yes you may! you can add a list of usernames to the feed generator and it will make a print-ready version of twitter. this is helpful for when you are on twitter on your laptop but wish you had Other Twitter as well, in print form.

## can you help me build an intuition for why a subset of the conic section parameter space is ellipsoid?

no! I don't have a good intuition for this myself. I know it to be true, but I can't come up with a compelling and straightforward way to present the proof to myself.


## sweet codes, bro. love it, dude! can i buy the creator a coffee?

no thank you! i encourage you to put that small amount of money toward a donation to an important organization, such as [planned parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-involved/other-ways-give). if you [tweet the receipt to me](https://twitter.com/j6m8), i'll send you a thank-you letter :)
