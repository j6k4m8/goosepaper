## what's up

goosepaper is a utility that delivers a daily newspaper to your remarkable tablet. that's cute!

you can include RSS feeds, Twitter feeds, news articles, wikipedia articles-of-the-day, weather, and more. I read it when I wake up so that I can feel anxious without having to get my phone.

## get started with docker

By far the easiest way to get started with Goosepaper is to use Docker.

### step 0: write your config file

Write a config file to tell Goosepaper what news you want to read. An example is provided in `example-config.json`.

### step 1: generate your paper

From the directory that has the config file in it, run the following:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/goosepaper j6k4m8/goosepaper goosepaper -c example-config.json
```

(where `example-config.json` is the name of the config file to use).

### step 2: you are done!

If you want to both generate the PDF as well as upload it to your reMarkable tablet, you can pass the `--upload` flag to the docker command above. You must additionally mount your `~/.rmapy` file:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/goosepaper -v $HOME/.rmapy:/root/.rmapy j6k4m8/goosepaper goosepaper -c example-config.json --upload
```

Otherwise, you can now email this PDF to your tablet, perhaps using [ReMailable](https://github.com/j6k4m8/remailable).

## get started without docker: installation

### dependencies:

this tool uses `weasyprint` to generate PDFs. You can install all of the python libraries you need with `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt` from this repo, but you may need these prerequisites before getting started.

more details [here](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

#### mac:

```shell
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi
```

#### ubuntu-flavored:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel python3-cffi libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info
```

#### windows:

[Follow these instructions carefully](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#windows).

## and then:

From inside the goosepaper repo,

```shell
pip3 install -e .
```

## get started

You can customize your goosepaper by editing `config.json`. (More instructions, and customization tools, all coming soon!)

```shell
goosepaper --config myconfig.json --output mypaper.pdf
```

If you don't pass an output flag, one will be generated based upon the time of generation. You DO need to pass a config file for now.

An example config file is included here: [example-config.json](example-config.json).

# More Questions, Infrequently Asked

### yes but pardon me â€” i haven't a remarkable tablet

Do you have another kind of tablet? You may generate a print-ready PDF which you can use on another kind of robot as well! Just remove the last line of `main.py`.

### very nice! may i have it in comic sans?

yes! you may do anything that you find to be fun and welcoming :)

Check out the `styles.Styles` enum in the goosepaper library. You will find there what you seek.

### do all dogs' names start with the letter "B"?

I do not think so, but it is a good question!

### may i use this to browse twitter?

yes you may! you can add a list of usernames to the feed generator and it will make a print-ready version of twitter. this is helpful for when you are on twitter on your laptop but wish you had Other Twitter as well, in print form.
